Used LLM tools: GitHub Copilot (Agent mode with claude sonnet 4) and Claude Code
Motivation for LLM usage: By using plan mode and agentic tools, I was able to concurrently develop the underlying applications (Hono, Go, Python).
After the initial applications were created according to my instructions, I was able to match them to the course requirements and dockerize them myself.
The tools mostly helped with development time as I didn't have to create all of the application code myself since that wasnt the main goal of the exercise.
One mistake the LLM's both made was mounting the storage to the volume which resulted in duplicate data in the log.txt. This however was an easy fix.
I think with good promting, tool instructions like CLAUDE.md, cursor rules etc, and thorough planning, this exercise is possible to be entirely done using LLM tools. I did not try to create it fully, but for what I used the tools for, it was able to create what I wanted.
